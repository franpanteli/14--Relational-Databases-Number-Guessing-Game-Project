# Relational-Databases-Number-Guessing-Game-Project
## Relational Databases Independent Learning
I independently completed [my fourteenth project](https://freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-number-guessing-game-project/build-a-number-guessing-game) in freeCodeCamp's [Relational Databases course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/) to improve my shell scripting and SQL skills. This curriculum consisted of 14 guided projects, to be completed in a Gitpod environment. My notes outlining the names (et al) of these guided projects are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/14--Relational-Databases-Number-Guessing-Game-Project/blob/main/0%20relational-databases-course-overview.txt). This repository is for the fourteenth of these projects I completed as part of this.

## Adding INSERT_THIS
### Problem Solving
For this project, I had to ...INSERT. My notes on the full task brief for this are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/14--Relational-Databases-Number-Guessing-Game-Project/blob/main/1%20project-task-notes.txt). 

### Solution Workflow 
- To complete this project, I used the CodeRoad extension in a VSCode virtual machine with Gitpod. I read through the project requirements, exported them as a PDF and [annotated them with my problem-solving approaches](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Number-Guessing-Game-Project/blob/main/Task%20Challenge%20Notes.pdf)
- The project Bash file ([number_guess.sh](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Number-Guessing-Game-Project/blob/main/number_guess.sh)) was first created and provided executable file permissions in a Bash prompt   
- The contents of this file was written in line with the project requirements, annotated in its notes file. The project SQL file ([number_guess.sql](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Number-Guessing-Game-Project/blob/main/number_guess.sql)) was then created, with a view to
